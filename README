# Cancer-Tumor-Classification
~ *by lemon, ayaa and nayla*

This repo will contain the notebook we worked on for the first challenge of Pinktober 2024.

The data set provided was used to train a plethora of models, the judging criteria was their F1 scores for which, the LightGBM model seemed to do best (as logistic regression failed us later on...)

To enhance the score, we used cross-validation and grid search to fine-tune the model even further.
